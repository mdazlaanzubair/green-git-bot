# GreenGitBot: Automated GitHub Contribution Enhancement System ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ±

Concerned about the sparse appearance of your GitHub contribution graph? Do you desire a more verdant profile that effectively showcases active development?  GreenGitBot provides a solution.

## What is GreenGitBot?

GreenGitBot is a Node.js-powered API designed to automatically enhance your GitHub contribution graph.  It functions as an automated system that cultivates your digital presence.  Upon configuration, it establishes a repository (named, by default, GitGreenBot) within your GitHub account and diligently adds daily commits, ensuring the consistent growth of your contribution graph.

### Key Features:

* **Automated Contribution Generation:** GreenGitBot eliminates the need for manual contribution activity.

* **Configurable Parameters:** Users provide essential credentials, including their GitHub token and username, to initiate the automated process.

* **Open Source Architecture:** GreenGitBot is open-source, facilitating community contributions to improve its functionality and maintain its operational integrity.

### How Does It Work?

* **Credential Provision:** The user supplies the API with their GitHub username and a personal access token.

* **Repository Establishment:** GreenGitBot creates a new repository in the user's account (named GitGreenBot by default).

* **Regular Commit Activity:** On a daily basis, GreenGitBot adds a small commit to the designated repository, incorporating randomly generated content into a file.

* **Contribution Graph Enhancement:** Over time, the accumulation of these daily commits contributes to a visually enhanced contribution graph, characterized by a greater number of green squares.

### How to Use GreenGitBot

**API Interaction:**

Utilize a tool such as curl or Postman to send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/gitgreenbot`:

```curl
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/gitgreenbot \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "username": "your-github-username",
    "token": "your-github-token",
    "repoName": "GitGreenBot",  // Or a custom repo name
    "fileName": "daily-commits" // The name of the file to create/update
  }'
```

* Replace `your-github-username` and `your-github-token` with your actual GitHub username and personal access token.

* You may customize the `repoName` and `fileName` parameters as needed.

* Monitor your GitHub profile to observe the appearance of new commits.
